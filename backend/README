This is the framework I've come up with. Steps to run -

bundle install
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed
bundle exec puma


Check what happens in each of the APIs -

localhost:9292/
localhost:9292/error/
localhost:9292/api/
localhost:9292/api/user/
localhost:9292/somerandompath


I've tried to remove redundant code as much as possible. I still have to add another section for the services like email etc.

Please go through it. We'll discuss it later in the day
